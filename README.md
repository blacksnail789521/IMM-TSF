# IMM-TSF Benchmark Library

Welcome to the **IMM-TSF** benchmark library, part of the Time-IMM dataset collection for NeurIPS 2025 Datasets & Benchmarks Track. This repository provides tools for loading irregular, multimodal time-series data and running reproducible forecasting benchmarks.

## 📁 Data Hierarchy

All datasets must follow the structure below for compatibility:

```
data/
└── {dataset_name}/
    └── processed/
        └── {entity_id}/
            ├── time_series.csv         # Multivariate, irregular time-series data
            ├── text.csv                # Associated unstructured text data
            └── text_embeddings_xxx.pt  # (Optional) Precomputed text embeddings
```

> ✅ **Example:** `data/EPA-Air/processed/Los_Angeles/time_series.csv` and `data/EPA-Air/processed/Los_Angeles/text.csv`

Each `{entity_id}` directory represents a unique data unit (e.g., a patient, sensor, or location) and should contain both structured and unstructured views of the data.

## 📥 Download Dataset

Please download the datasets from one of the following sources:
* 💻 **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-IMM](https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-IMM)
* 📎 **Kaggle Dataset:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm)

After downloading, extract the files and place them under the appropriate folder within the `data/` directory, following the hierarchy above.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/IMM-TSF.git
   cd IMM-TSF
   ```

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a **conda** environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n immtsf python=3.10
   conda activate immtsf
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> ✅ Using `conda` helps manage dependencies and avoid platform-specific conflicts.

## 🚀 Usage

You can run experiments in multiple ways:

### 1. Direct invocation (`main.py`)

Use command-line arguments for flexible training and evaluation:

```bash
python main.py \
  --data_name GDELT \
  --model_name tPatchGNN \
  --TTF_module TTF_RecAvg \
  --TTF_RecAvg MMF_GR_Add \
  --llm_model_fusion GPT2 \
  --batch_size 32 \
  --use_text_embeddings True \ 
  ...
```

Use `--help` to view all available flags.

### 2. `go.sh` wrapper

Edit default arguments in `main.py` and then launch an experiment:

```bash
. go.sh
```

This script sources predefined parameters and launches your run in one command.

---

## ⚡ Precomputing Text Embeddings

To speed up training by avoiding repeated LLM computation, you can precompute embeddings using:

```bash
python compute_text_embeddings.py
```

* This stores `text_embeddings_xxx.pt` under each `processed/{entity_id}/` folder.
* To use the precomputed embeddings, add `--use_text_embeddings True` when running `main.py`.
> **Note:** Please make sure you have at least **24GB total GPU RAM** to run **LLaMA 3.1** and **DeepSeek** models.

---

## 📊 Run All Benchmarks

To benchmark all model–dataset combinations:

```bash
. main_all.sh
```

This automates evaluation across all supported configurations.

## 🔄 MIMIC Preprocessing

Due to access restrictions, raw MIMIC data must be downloaded manually. Please follow the instruction here:

```
data/MIMIC/mimic_preprocess.ipynb
```

This will generate processed files in:

```
data/MIMIC/processed/{entity_id}/
├── time_series.csv
└── text.csv
```
